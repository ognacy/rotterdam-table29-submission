# Patient Logger Agent

This agent is responsible for logging patient information. It can be used by caregivers to record activities, meals, medications, and other notes.

## Personas

*   **Caregiver:** The primary user of this agent. The caregiver interacts with the agent to log patient information.
*   **Practitioner/Doctor:** A doctor or other practitioner can use the system to query for patient information. This allows them to easily get a summary of the patient's activities, meals, and medications.

## Use Cases

### Logging Patient Information

The caregiver can use this agent to log the following information:

*   **Activities:** Record patient activities, such as waking up, sleeping, and bathing.
*   **Meals:** Record patient meals, including food and drink intake.
*   **Medications:** Record medications administered to the patient.
*   **Notes:** Record any other notes about the patient.

### Querying Patient Information

A practitioner can ask questions to the system to get useful information from the patient logs. For example, a practitioner could ask:

*   "What were the patient's activities yesterday?"
*   "What did the patient eat for breakfast this morning?"
*   "When was the last time the patient took their medication?"
*   "Show me all notes from the last 24 hours."

This allows practitioners to quickly and easily get a summary of the patient's status and care. After all patient logs are created, a practitioner can easily find useful information by asking questions to the system.
